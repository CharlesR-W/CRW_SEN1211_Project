This folder contains the submission for the agent-based modelling project of the class SEN1211 "Agent-Based Modelling" at TU Delft offered in Quarter 2, academic year 2022-2023.


Per instructions, the files constituting the operational model are located in the 'model' folder.

A PDF file of the report is preserved in the main directory.

The final plots used in the body of the report are saved in the 'analysis' folder, along with the post-processing script which created them.

The figures in the appendix of the report are generated from mesa itself - the code generating which was deprecated, but may be found commented out in the 'main.py' file of the model folder.

The 'base_mesa_model' and '__pycache__' folders are not pertinent to the report, but contain some data which may be necessary to reduplicate its conclusions (at least by the authors' current minimal understanding of anaconda's packaging system); thus they are included 'just in case'.


NB: the default output pickle files are NOT reproduced in this repo due to their size

Please send an email to CharlesRW@protonmail.com if there are any questions or unexpected issues :)
